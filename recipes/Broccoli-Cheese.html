    <p>My mom made this broccoli cheese casserole every Thanksgiving when I was little. We kids could never get enough! 
        If you have children or have some coming to visit you as guests this Thanksgiving, 
        I guarantee that they will eat (and enjoy) this veggie dish. 
        It's also fabulous with a Christmas ham.
